            "title": "The Father of English Geology",


            "passage": "William Smith, 1769–1839, has been called the ‘Father of English Geology’. His pioneering map of 1815, depicting the geology of England, Wales and part of Scotland, helped to shape the economic and scientific development of Britain, just as the country was experiencing the Industrial Revolution.\n\nWilliam Smith was born in rural Oxfordshire in 1769. The son of the village blacksmith, Smith was the eldest of five children. After elementary education at the village school, where he developed a liking for geometry and drawing, he decided to teach himself the skills of surveying, possibly because there were an increasing number of openings for that profession. At the age of 18 he was employed by Edward Webb, a surveyor in a nearby town, and subsequently, in 1791, he set up in business on his own.\n\nAs a boy, Smith had developed an interest in the exposures of rock and the fossils which were to be found locally. As an adult, his surveys of land that would be suitable for building canals, and for sources of building stone and coal in other parts of England, led to a great increase in his knowledge and awareness of various geological features.\n\nAs he travelled, he found the strata* that he was familiar with in the south of England were repeated in other areas, with some outcrops – the rocks emerging above ground – stretching right across the country. Coal miners were already aware of the occurrences of regular successions of workable coal seams. But on a larger scale, Smith began to recognise that sedimentary rocks could be identified by the fossils they contained, and that these rocks were always arranged in the same order. Smith’s discovery that beds of rocks can be distinguished by the fossils found in them was a concept virtually unrecognised by geologists of that period.\n\nWorking on this principle, Smith was able to draw up a table of successive strata which could be applied in any other locality – an early version of the geological column.\n\nBy 1799, Smith was using both his skills as a surveyor and the knowledge gained from his observations in the field to draw up a geological map. This first map was circular in form, covered the area around the city of Bath, and was exhibited at the Bath Agricultural Society. At the same time, Smith continued to plan the publication of a treatise describing his discoveries, but financial support proved difficult to find. In 1801, Smith produced a small geological map of England and Wales which illustrated the outcrops of seven geological formations.\n\nOther maps were produced for exhibition at various meetings, but it was not until 1815 that, with input from the enterprising map publisher John Cary, Smith’s first major map actually appeared. It was called ‘A delineation of the Strata of England and Wales with part of Scotland; exhibiting the Collieries and Mines, the Marshes and Fen Lands originally overflowed by the Sea, and the varieties of soil according to the variations in the substrata, illustrated by the most descriptive names’.\n\nBased on Cary’s new topographical map at the scale of five miles to the inch, Smith’s map showed the outcrops of some twenty formations. Other publications on stratigraphy followed, including his major mapping publication ‘Geological Atlas’, comprising maps of 21 counties. Published between 1819 and 1824, these maps represent a first attempt at systematic sheet mapping of England and Wales.\n\nDespite the importance of his ideas and publications, Smith continued to find recognition elusive and it was not until 1831, when the Geological Society awarded him the first Wollaston Medal, that the importance of his achievements was finally acknowledged. In his citation, the geologist Adam Sedgwick called Smith the ‘Founder of English Geology’.\n\nFrom time to time Smith’s expertise continued to be drawn upon for major projects. In 1838 he was commissioned to accompany Henry De la Beche and Sir Charles Barry on a tour of the principal stone quarries to recommend the stone to be used in the rebuilding of the Houses of Parliament, which had been destroyed by fire in 1835. The practical nature of the commission provides a link between Smith’s work and that of De la Beche and his newly founded Geological Survey.\n\nThe main focus of Smith’s work was to apply his observations and ideas to the everyday needs of the canal builders, quarry‑ and mine‑owners, landowners and agriculturists who were underpinning the Industrial Revolution. His understanding of geology enabled him to predict where coal or different types of stone could be found, which was very useful for mining companies. He talked at meetings about geology and its valuable contribution to the national economy.\n\nThe methods involved in map production have developed and the ways in which people access maps have altered radically since Smith’s time. However, his conviction that geological mapping is of vital importance at many levels and in many areas of the nation’s society, science, and industry is as true today as it was two centuries ago, when he conceived his original geological map. It is as vital for today’s industries to be provided with accurate geological map data as it was in Smith’s time.",

But what if modern intensive farming methods have affected the mineral and vitamin content of what we eat? Donald Davis, at the University of Texas, has found notable declines in nutrients in crops including tomatoes, eggplants and squash. Davis blames agricultural practices that emphasise quantity over quality. High-yielding crops produce more food, more rapidly, but they can’t make or absorb nutrients at the same pace, so the nutrition is diluted. ‘It’s like taking a glass of orange juice and adding water to it. If you do that, the concentration of nutrients that was in the original juice drops,’ he says. But the idea that modern farming produces less nourishing crops remains controversial, since nutrient levels can vary widely according to the variety of plant, the year of harvest and the time of harvest."

                    "text": "But intensive farming has also led to a huge increase in food supply, which has undoubtedly had a positive effect on our diet and health. ‘Evidence suggests that some nutrients have fallen, particularly trace elements such as copper in vegetables,’ says Paul Finglas, at the Institute of Food Research in Norwich. ‘Foods are now bred for yield, and not necessarily nutritional composition. But I don’t think that is a problem, because we eat a wider range of foods today than we did 10 years ago, let alone 40 years ago’. Eric Decker, professor of food science at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, agrees. If nutrients are declining, the losses are insignificant, he says. ‘Over the last century, lifespans have got longer, people are bigger and stronger, and a lot of that has to do with the food supply being better.’ Even Davis agrees that any differences in nutrient levels are relatively small. ‘Despite their declines, fruit and vegetables are still our richest source of many nutrients, and you can make up for it by eating more,’ he says. ‘But we know that many people don’t get the recommended amounts of nutrients such as iron, magnesium, and calcium. They aren’t overt deficiencies in the usual sense, but they increase susceptibility to lots of different problems.’"

                    "text": "In addition to changes in its production, food is being transported for ever-increasing distances. Fruit and vegetables in supermarkets might look shiny and fresh, but often they were picked several days earlier. Some nutrients, particularly vitamin C and folic acid, begin to deteriorate as soon as picking happens, but manufacturers can take action to minimise this. ‘Lots of these reactions are driven by enzymes,’ says Carol Wagstaff, from the University of Reading, UK, who points out that chilling is the best way of slowing down such reactions. That said, if you are choosing between organic fruit or vegetables from a distant country or locally grown, non-organic ones, always opt for home-grown, she says. ‘From a nutritional standpoint, go for the shortest possible supply chain rather than the production method.’ Many kinds of mass-produced fruit and veg – most famously tomatoes – are harvested unripe before being transported to supermarkets. Wagstaff agrees that this may cause some loss of flavor, compared with a tomato that you have grown at home, and left on the plant until it’s absolutely ready to eat. ‘But there’s no way you could do that at a commercial level, because of the bruising and other types of damage that would occur if ripe fruits were transported through a typical supply chain,’ she says. In addition, each method of shipping and storing foods has different effects on the compounds they contain. Vitamin C, for example, breaks down in the dark, whereas glucosinolates – found in vegetables like cabbage – deplete in the light."

                    "text": "Surprisingly, frozen fruit and vegetables are often nutritionally better than fresh. ‘Frozen peas are much more nutritious than those you buy ready to shell,’ says Catherine Collins, principal dietician at St George’s Hospital in London. What’s more, frozen foods often have fewer additives. ‘Freezing is a preservative,’ she says. Similarly, processing has become a maligned word in the context of food, but there are some cases where it enhances a food’s health benefits. For example, lycopene – a compound tomatoes are rich in, and which has been shown to protect against certain diseases – is much more readily absorbed by humans from tomato paste than fresh tomatoes. A recent trend is the sale of ‘fresh-cut’ fruit and vegetables – peeled potatoes, ready chopped carrots and bagged salads. One in five adults in the UK regularly buys fruit and vegetables in this form every week, according to market research firm Mintel. Surely this cutting and peeling speeds up the degradation of nutrients? ‘There is a chance that ready prepared vegetables may have a lower content of some vitamins,’ says Judy Buttriss, of the British Nutrition Foundation in London. ‘But if their availability means that such vegetables are consumed in greater quantities, then the net effect is beneficial.’"

He believes this will make a far greater difference to us than worrying about growing methods and transportation."

            "passage": "In Holland they have developed a creative landscape philosophy called ‘New Nature’, and the most iconic illustration of this is the site called the Oostvaardersplassen, near Amsterdam. Here, throughout 6,000 enclosed hectares, feral Heck bulls excavate amphibian ponds with their hooves and horns, while stags and stallions battle fiercely for possession of herds of females. These creatures present a living vision that many ‘rewilders’ adore.\n\nAlthough this project may present a primeval impression, in reality it is a completely artificial – though courageous – creation, limited by fences, budgets, an adjacent main railway line, surrounding land users and fickle political support. Less than a lifetime ago the landscape these ‘wild’ herbivores now occupy was the bed of the North Sea.\n\nDespite the contention that surrounds such projects, the Oostvaardersplassen has produced some inspirational results. Spoonbills have returned to breed in ever‑increasing numbers, creating a surplus population which has overlapped back into Britain. Sea eagles have raised their first nestlings in centuries, nourished by the ample supply of deer that the site affords. Projects of this type, which restore key species or re‑engineer landscapes to allow natural processes such as seasonal flooding or forest fires to re‑occur, have demonstrated that when nature is given free rein the results can be spectacular. Are we, however, prepared to live in landscapes where these processes, even if appropriately modified, become part of our own experience?\n\nWhile space is without doubt one of the biggest obstacles facing rewilders, a range of structural, social and cultural issues can also conspire to hinder change. For example, I have been involved with the restoration of the Eurasian beaver – a large rodent that builds complex structures from wood, stones and mud across rivers – in Britain since the early 1990s. Although they once had a world range which extended from Britain to China and numbered tens of millions, beavers were hunted virtually to extinction by humans as a result of an insatiable demand for their fur, scent glands and meat. They have now been widely re‑introduced throughout much of their former European range as awareness of their critical function in creating wetland habitats has developed. Beaver‑generated landscapes also play a significant part in the retention and purification of water.\n\nThere is an abundance of entirely suitable beaver habitat available in Britain, and despite the fact that occasional conflicts will arise between beavers’ engineering activities and human land use, European experience shows these conflicts are manageable. Despite this knowledge, beaver restoration in Britain has been pitifully slow. Political apathy and indifference have coupled with a lack of knowledge among opponents who want no change to the status quo. Official trials in Scotland and England have focused on creating tiny populations which remain extremely fragile.\n\nIf a species as benevolent as the beaver presents a significant challenge, how much more difficult will it be to restore predators? While science and experience show that wolves pose no significant threat to humans, their tentative recolonisation of many western European countries in recent decades has often evoked a primal response. Farmers’ groups have trapped them in pits in France and burnt them to death; hunters have poisoned them for killing ‘their’ deer; kindergarten teachers have implored authorities to remove them lest they lurk in the dark when children go to school on winter mornings. Attitude change, it seems, is a slow and painful process, not easily turned round by knowledge.\n\nAny start to rewilding is therefore likely to be humble. A measured approach is probable, yet fishermen and their strident support groups may not welcome the addition of the pelican, a 15‑kg water‑bird, to the large number of predators they already detest. The scientific community may dislike the pragmatism required on a semi‑industrial scale to restore small species to remake the base of essential food chains if newly available habitats emerge. Many farmers, despite the sums they would be paid, will not wish to see their once‑drained bogs rehydrated, their dead animals consumed by sea eagles or their pastures revert to scrub.\n\nIn the end it comes down to changing patterns. We have moulded the landscapes of the world to suit our own passing needs, predilections and pleasures. While change is commonly opposed on whatever basis arises, change is nevertheless a constant in life. It is likely that ‘rewilding’ or ‘New Nature’ – call it what you will – could become a base movement affording a fresh opportunity to approach nature conservation in a fashion which will, over time, be all the more rewarding for the surprises it presents.",
